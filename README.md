# When I Get Free

# Game Description
When I Get Free is a 2D, action, strategy, visual comic game inspired by the New Testament developed for mobile on the Unity Engine. It combines elements of an interactive visual comic with short gameplay segments and levels that creates a unique experience and immerses players in the world and story of its characters.

# Role on the Project
During the Summer of 2020, I worked as a Systems Engineer for the game, developing new tools and systems as well as adding features and quality-of-life changes to existing gameplay. In collaboration with the director of the project, I implemented a custom comic sequence tool that allowed for designers to quickly develop and iterate on a series of visual comic panels without having to touch any code or have a deep understanding of the internals. Utilizing feedback from past testing and from new playtests that I had run, I incorporated small changes into one of the gameplay segments to provide more visual feedback to the player and removed some issues and bugs that arrose from the current system.

# Implemented Systems and Features
Some of the systems and features that I have worked on or implemented during my time include:
 - Custom Comic Panel System that allowed for the visual comic sequence to incorporate video clips and animating graphic panels along with specialized interactive transitions
 - Quality-of-Life Changes to the Puzzle gameplay sections such as a zoom in feature, puzzle piece highlights, and improving the instructions/tutorial section
