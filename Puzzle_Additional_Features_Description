Puzzle Gameplay Additional Features:

Description:
The puzzle gameplay sequence was already built and incorporated into the game. It featured a series of movable and flippable pieces that can be rearranged to form an image. Each time a section of the puzzle was completed it would play a short video and some audio until the whole puzzle was complete. A lot of the changes I made mostly involved fixing bugs and issues that came up in playtesting as well as ways to better communicate to the player what was happening/needed to be done visually. Some of these visual changes and additional features include:
 - Adding a highlighted background behind pieces that are movable/flippable
 - Adding in a zoom in button to get a closer look at pieces
 - Adding a skip instructions button at the tutorial in the beginning of the puzzle
 - Cleaning up the tutorial sequence and adding hidden restrictions such as preventing the player from placing a piece in the wrong spot so they don't make a mistake and lose all their turns
 - Made the pieces overall larger so it is easier to tell which piece connects where
